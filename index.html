            <h3>Problem Identified & Proposed Solutions</h3>
            <h4>Misinterpretation of Electric Symbols</h4>
            <p>Happens when people misunderstand or confuse the meanings of symbols in electrical diagrams. This can lead to faulty wiring, equipment damage, safety risks, and miscommunication among electricians, engineers, and workers.</p>
            <h4>Use of Standard Symbols </h4>
            <p>- Always follow international standards like IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) or ANSI to maintain uniformity.
</p>
            <h4>Updated Reference Materials</h4>
            <p>- Use updated electrical diagrams, manuals, and symbol charts to avoid confusion.</p>
            <h3>Reflections</h3>
            <p>Misinterpretation of electric symbols can lead to problems such as wiring errors, equipment damage, and safety hazards. By using standardized symbols and updated reference materials, these issues can be reduced. Standard symbols create a common language for everyone involved, while updated references ensure accuracy and clarity. Together, they promote safety, efficiency, and proper communication, helping individuals and organizations avoid costly mistakes and improve overall electrical work quality.</p>
